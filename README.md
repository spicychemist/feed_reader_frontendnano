This will allow you to test a variety of functions on the feed reader. In order to use this test program, load index.html into your browser.  There will be multiple tests as described below:


1) It will make sure a URL is defined and not empty.
2) It will confirm that each feed has a name and that it is not empty.
3) It will ensure the menu is hidden by default.
4) It will ensure the visibility changes when you click on the menu icon.
5) It will ensure the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6) It will ensure when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
7) It will ensure when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
